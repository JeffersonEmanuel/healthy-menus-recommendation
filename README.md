# healthy-menus-recommendation-optimizing-the-use-of-the-pantry
We are often unable to plan menus ahead, thus making poor and unhealthy choices of meals. Besides being healthy, one may want menus where the ingredients harmonize well and cover well the available ingredients in the pantry. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective-based recommender of menus that features an optimal balance between nutritional aspects, harmony and coverage of available ingredients. We conduct experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets and show that our approach achieves an optimal balance between the required level of nutrients, harmonization and coverage of ingredients.
